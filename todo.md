# TO-DO list

## Country Inspector, v2
- experimental-branch: remove generic type from `interface CommandObject<H>` and see what happens.
- history navigation via arrows (another investigation on working with console in character mode)

----
## Geometry Enthusiast
- write down the functional requirements for 2D and 3D figures.
- think about adding length to the models.
- Write down the entities required for the implementation based on the Country Inspector Postmortem.

----
## Command Line Parser
- Base project all other may have to rely on: command-line parser for covering more advanced use cases
  like dashed parameters and arguments with spaces. Additional materials:
