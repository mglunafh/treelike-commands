# Command objects

1. Every command should have a description, thus, every command object should have `-h|--help` option 
   which has the highest priority.
2. There are simple commands for every geometrical figure which don't take any arguments and just show the basic info.
3. **TODO**: for `show` command describe the possible option combinations
4. **TODO**: `tags` + `tag add` + `tag remove` -> `tag [--show | --add <list of tags> | --remove <list of tags>]`
