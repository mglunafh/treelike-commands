# Command objects

1. Every command should have a description, thus, every command object should have `-h|--help` option 
   which has the highest priority.
2. There are simple commands for every geometrical figure which don't take any arguments and just show the basic info.
3. If the command has option besides the help, it should have high-level description as well as comments to the options
